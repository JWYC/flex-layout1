            <header>Hi. I'm Janis</header>
            <main>I am a responsive designer and developer that seeks to tell compelling visual stories and fantastic user experiences. When I am not working or learning more about coding and design, I am enjoying a great book (or comic book) and a cup of tea while a new recipe is slowly cooking in my oven.</main>
            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                <p>I am based in Metro Vancouver one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The thing I love the most about living here is the cuisine. You can find food from every corner of the globe here. I think that's why my cookbook collection is so diverse. I love recipes from the Middle East, South East Asia, and India. (I have a go-to Italian one too ;)<p>
            </div>
            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>Can there be too many books? Never! Tea and a good book is my idea of a perfect afternoon. I read a wide variety of books, but the common theme in the classics, mysteries and old spy novels i love are teams and adventure. Perhaps that's why I recently feel hard for the Nightwing comic books. (I'm a completest so, no spoilers please.)</p>
            </div>
            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>Weird Fact: I woke up one day and decided that I am a coder. I was a political science major and enjoyed a stint working for the government, but I just knew coding was for me. I'm a Communciations Manager who often takes on IT project managment roles at work. When I come home every night I get to do what I love, which is code and build amazing experiences online.</p>
